# Description

Visting Home page we find a link in `Â© BornToSec` in the footer of the page.

If we checked the source code of the html file we find this string

```html
<!--
You must come from : "https://www.nsa.gov/".
-->
```

As it seems that we need to change to referer of the request so that it the webserver thinks that the request is comming from `https://www.nsa.gov/`

# Prevent

- **Referrer Header Check:** Implement a server-side check that verifies the Referer header of incoming requests. If the request is supposed to come from a specific source, make sure it matches that source. If it doesn't, deny the request.

- **Use Same-Origin Policy:** Leverage the Same-Origin Policy to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests. Configure your server to disallow requests from domains other than your own.

- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** If you need to allow certain cross-origin requests, set up CORS properly. Specify which origins are allowed to access your resources by configuring CORS headers on the server.
